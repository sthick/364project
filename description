We want to build an application that would allow users to catalog independent coffee shops that they have visited and also find recommendations based on location. The application would be similar to yelp and similar review sites that allow searching of preferences and picture descriptions with reviews. 

The application would allow users to upload new coffee shops or edit old entries including personal reviews, images, and menu recommendations. Users will be able to build profiles by logging in and from there they can add friends with similar coffee shop preferences and build their networks. Users can also search based on geographic location, rating, or other descriptive categories to find coffee shops that they would be interested in checking out.
